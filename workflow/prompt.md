// Phase 1: Comprehensive Regulatory Analysis
//
// Perform an Comprehensive Regulatory Analysis on Australian Privacy Principles - Chapter 11: APP 11 Security of personal information
// In the context of adopting a policy-as-code approach, the primary step involves a detailed analysis of the regulatory environment to 
// identify areas where compliance requirements can be translated into technical rules for automation. This process is crucial for organisations, 
// especially in sectors like fintech in Australia, where regulatory compliance is both complex and mandatory. 
// The goal is to focus on policy domains that offer clear pathways for codification into technical controls and automated monitoring systems.

// Phase 2: Formulating Compliance Mandates with Complete Details
//
// Formulate Compliance Mandates 
// Following the comprehensive regulatory analysis, the next pivotal step in implementing a policy-as-code framework is the distillation
// of these regulatory requirements into clear, actionable compliance mandates. This process involves translating the broad and often complex
// language of regulations into discrete, specific mandates that directly inform the creation of technical controls and configurations.
// The aim is to produce a set of actionable, codifiable rules that can be automated within technology environments.*
// Each mandate should clearly state what needs to be done, how it should be done, and who is responsible. 
// This clarity is crucial for the next stage, where these mandates are codified into policy rules.
