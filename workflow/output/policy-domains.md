# Policy Domains for Compliance Automation

The comprehensive analysis of the attached regulations document has identified key policy domains where compliance requirements can be automated. These domains are crucial for ensuring the security and proper handling of personal information in accordance with APP 11. The identified policy domains are:

## Data Security Management
Ensures the implementation of robust ICT security measures to protect personal information from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification, or disclosure.

## Data Retention and Destruction
Focuses on the policies and procedures for retaining personal information only as long as necessary for legal or business purposes and securely destroying or de-identifying it when no longer needed.

## Access Control and Management
Outlines the methods and technologies to restrict access to personal information to authorised personnel only, including measures to verify the identity of individuals accessing the data.

## Data Breach Response Procedures
Establishes the framework for responding to data breaches, including notification procedures and steps to mitigate the impact of breaches on affected individuals.

## Third-party Data Processor Management
Defines the requirements for managing third-party service providers who handle personal information, ensuring they comply with the same security and privacy standards.

This list forms the foundation for developing specific compliance mandates and the subsequent creation of technical controls to enforce these mandates.
