# Compliance Mandates for Access Control and Encryption

To effectively translate the requirements of APP 11 into actionable compliance mandates for access control and encryption, it is essential to articulate these mandates in a manner that is both precise and actionable. This will ensure that they can be directly implemented within an organisation's technical infrastructure and policy-as-code frameworks. Below are formulated compliance mandates focusing on access control and encryption, derived from the regulatory analysis of APP 11.

# Compliance Mandates for Access Control

1. Mandate on Access Control Policies
- Requirement: Implement comprehensive access control policies that restrict access to personal information to only those individuals who require it to perform their job functions.
- Implementation: Utilise role-based access control (RBAC) systems to define and enforce access permissions based on job roles. Regularly review and update access permissions to reflect changes in employment status or roles.
- Responsibility: The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is responsible for the development of access control policies, while IT managers are responsible for their implementation and enforcement.

2. Mandate on User Authentication
- Requirement: Ensure robust user authentication mechanisms are in place to verify the identity of users accessing personal information.
- Implementation: Deploy multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all systems and applications that store or process personal information. This should include a combination of something the user knows (password), something the user has (security token), and/or something the user is (biometric verification).
- Responsibility: IT security teams are responsible for implementing and maintaining authentication mechanisms.

3. Mandate on Access Logging and Monitoring
- Requirement: Maintain detailed logs of access to personal information and monitor these logs for unauthorised access attempts.
- Implementation: Implement automated logging and monitoring tools that record access events and generate alerts for suspicious activities. Ensure logs are retained for a minimum period as defined by organisational policy or regulatory requirements.
- Responsibility: The cybersecurity operations team is responsible for the oversight of access logging and monitoring activities.

# Compliance Mandates for Encryption

1. Mandate on Data Encryption at Rest
- Requirement: Encrypt all personal information stored within the organisation's systems to protect against unauthorised access.
- Implementation: Utilise industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) for encrypting data at rest. Encryption keys must be managed securely, with access restricted to authorised personnel only.
- Responsibility: IT managers are responsible for ensuring that data at rest is encrypted, and the IT security team is responsible for managing encryption keys.

2. Mandate on Data Encryption in Transit
- Requirement: Encrypt personal information during transmission over public or unsecured networks to prevent interception and unauthorised access.
- Implementation: Use secure communication protocols such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) for all data in transit. Ensure that all transmitted data is encrypted end-to-end from the source to the destination.
- Responsibility: Network security teams are responsible for implementing and configuring secure transmission protocols.

3. Mandate on Encryption Key Management
- Requirement: Implement a secure encryption key management system to protect and manage cryptographic keys throughout their lifecycle.
- Implementation: Deploy a centralised key management platform that supports key generation, distribution, rotation, and revocation. Ensure that access to the key management system is strictly controlled and audited.
- Responsibility: The IT security team is responsible for the oversight of encryption key management practices.

# Conclusion 
By clearly defining these mandates, organisations can ensure that their approach to access control and encryption is aligned with the requirements of APP 11, thereby protecting personal information from unauthorised access, modification, or disclosure. These mandates serve as a foundation for developing technical controls and configurations that can be automated within an organisation's IT environment, facilitating compliance and enhancing data security.
