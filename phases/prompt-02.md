***Formulate Compliance Mandates for* Access Control and Encryption**

*Following the comprehensive regulatory analysis, the next pivotal step in implementing a policy-as-code framework is the distillation of these regulatory requirements into clear, actionable compliance mandates. This process involves translating the broad and often complex language of regulations into discrete, specific mandates that directly inform the creation of technical controls and configurations. The aim is to produce a set of actionable, codifiable rules that can be automated within technology environments.*

*Each mandate should clearly state what needs to be done, how it should be done, and who is responsible. This clarity is crucial for the next stage, where these mandates are codified into policy rules.*
